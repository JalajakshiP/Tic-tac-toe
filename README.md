# Tic-tac-toe

This program is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. It employs basic 2D arrays without implementing the minimax algorithm. 
It allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. Additionally, there's an option to play against a computer opponent. The program handles player input, checks for wins or draws, and prints the current state of the board after each move.
